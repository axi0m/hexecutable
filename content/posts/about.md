# About Me

Hello! 👋

For my day job I work at a Fortune 500 company helping with offensive security and network security monitoring. I am a consummate student of Information Security/Cybersecurity. My current focus areas include Red Team Ops, Infrastructure, and Python. Historically I've worked on large scale enterprise SIEM deployments, full-packet capture systems, forward and reverse proxies, etc.

When I'm not working I spend my time playing RPG games [🧙‍♂️](https://dnd.wizards.com/), board games [🎲](https://www.cmon.com/news/cthulhu-death-may-die-overview), and watching Sci-Fi films [👾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner).
